	 * In cryptography, a one-time pad is a system in which a private key generated
	 * randomly is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted by the
	 * receiver using a matching one-time pad and key. Messages encrypted with keys
	 * based on randomness have the advantage that there is theoretically no way to
	 * "break the code" by analyzing a succession of messages. Each encryption is
	 * unique and bears no relation to the next encryption so that some pattern can
	 * be detected. With a one-time pad, however, the decrypting party must have
	 * access to the same key used to encrypt the message and this raises the
	 * problem of how to get the key to the decrypting party safely or how to keep
	 * both keys secure.
