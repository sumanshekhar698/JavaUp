/*the volatile keyword is not foolproof. It can help to prevent visibility problems in some cases, but it is not a guarantee. There are still some situations where the changes made to a volatile variable may not be visible to other threads immediately.

For example, if a volatile variable is stored in a cache, the changes made to the variable in memory may not be reflected in the cache immediately. This is because the cache may not be updated as frequently as memory.

Another issue is that the volatile keyword does not guarantee that the changes made to a variable will be seen by all threads. If a thread is blocked waiting for a lock, it will not see the changes made to a volatile variable until the lock is released.

Overall, the volatile keyword is a useful tool for preventing visibility problems, but it is not a complete solution. If you are writing multithreaded code that relies on the visibility of shared variables, you should carefully consider the potential for visibility problems and take steps to mitigate them.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind about the volatile keyword:

ðŸ”¹The volatile keyword only guarantees that the changes made to a variable will be visible to other threads immediately if the variable is stored in main memory.
ðŸ”¹The volatile keyword does not guarantee that the changes made to a variable will be seen by all threads.
ðŸ”¹The volatile keyword can have a performance impact, so it should only be used when necessary.*/
